1. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
I would like to have added a feature in which a player could play their favorite song. For example, there can be an option where the player can paste a URL link (ex. using Spotify or Youtube) of a song and the game can generate the instrumental version. The game would be able to recreate the sound of the song by playing the tunes, allowing the player to be able to play the song using the buttons. If I were to be able to implement this feature, I would have to add more buttons to the keyboard in order to be able to play more tunes. Adding more tunes allows for the song to better match the notes of the song.
Another feature I would implement is allowing for the player to play against someone else using the same song. This way, player 1 would be competing against player 2 to finish the song accurately and faster. I believe this makes the game more fun because it would make the player think quickly and deeply about the accurately recreating the sound to beat their opponent.
